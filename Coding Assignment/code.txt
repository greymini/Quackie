Explanation
normalize_code Function:

Purpose: This function normalizes a given piece of Python code by removing unnecessary newlines and spaces.
How It Works:
It uses regular expressions to replace sequences of whitespace and newlines with a single space.
It ensures that there are no unnecessary spaces around parentheses by using regular expressions.
resolve_diff Function:

Purpose: This function identifies the differences between two Python code snippets while ignoring comments.
How It Works:
It filters out comments from the code snippets.
It normalizes the non-comment code snippets by converting them into single-line strings and removing unnecessary spaces.
It then splits the normalized code into lists of strings.
Finally, it compares the two lists and identifies the differences, returning them as a list of strings.
resolve_categorized_diff Function:

Purpose: This function identifies and categorizes the differences between two Python code snippets into interpreter, formatting, and comment differences.
How It Works:
It extracts comment lines from the code snippets.
It filters out non-comment lines from the code snippets.
It normalizes the non-comment code snippets by converting them into single-line strings and removing unnecessary spaces.
It then splits the normalized code into lists of strings.
It identifies differences in the interpreter lines and the raw lines (which include formatting).
It categorizes the differences and returns them as a list of dictionaries.
Main Section:

Purpose: This section demonstrates how to use the resolve_diff and resolve_categorized_diff functions with example code snippets.
How It Works:
It defines three code snippets: snippet_a, snippet_b, and snippet_c.
It prints the differences between snippet_a and snippet_b, and between snippet_b and snippet_c using the resolve_diff function.
It prints the categorized differences between snippet_a and snippet_b using the resolve_categorized_diff function.
